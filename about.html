						<h4>Charles Tillmon</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="profileContent">
						<p>Charles Tillmon's Journey began when he was young. Constantly finding himself intrigued with how technology worked all around him. From how a
						remote could control the channels on a television without a physical connection to how cell phones could allow people to communicate at distances that would be previously be deemed impossible.
						This is what drives Charles to seek a deeper understanding of technology. He believes that technology can push the boundaries of what is possible and like any skill when mastered he can leverage it 
						to help others. 
						</p>
						<p>Charles' current focus is to master Full Stack Web Development. He believes that an understanding of all aspects of a project will allow him be self-proficient but also be able to serve team 
						members in the areas of need. His belief is that mastering a skill to the level where you can teach it will not only help developing the skills of those under your mentorship

						<h4>Jasmine Cochran</h4> 
					</div>
					<div class="profileContent">
						<p>Jasmine Cochran's Journey within Software engineering can be traced all the way back to high school. Elective classes would introduce Jasmine to her passion for technology and  
						her curiosity would lead her to create her very first website during her sophomore year. This would be a continued theme in her life as she would participate in research groups during 
						her time at the New York City College of Technology, Medgar Evers College or her work within the VA Hospital. As this illustrates she has been headed into the sciences from the very beginning. 
						Her passion is based in her love to create and it is her mission that whatever results from her creations or collaborations inspire and help others. </p>
						<p>Jasmine's favorite languages consist of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, SQL, and C++ </p>
						<p>Outside of developing, Jasmine loves to dabble in art no matter what the form is. From photography to painting to creative writing she explores various techniques in an effort to find different 
						angles in which to portray her perspective of the world. Leaving no detail unaccounted for!
